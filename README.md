## Architecture Overview

The system follows a **layered architecture** with strict tenant isolation.

Each request is authenticated using **JWT** and scoped to a tenant using middleware.
The frontend communicates with the backend via **REST APIs**, and all tenant data
is isolated at the database level using a `tenant_id`.

## 🔐 Audit Logs

### Overview
This application includes an **Audit Logging system** to track critical actions performed within the platform.  
Audit logs improve **security, traceability, and accountability**, which are essential for multi-tenant SaaS systems.

---

### What Is Logged
The system automatically records the following actions:

- User creation, update, and deletion
- Project creation, update, and deletion
- Task creation, updates, status changes, and deletion
- Tenant updates (name and subscription plan changes)
- Administrative actions performed by Super Admins
---

### Where Audit Logs Are Stored
Audit logs are stored in the **`audit_logs` table** in the PostgreSQL database.
---

### How to Access Audit Logs

#### Database Access (superadmin / Debugging)
Audit logs can be inspected directly from the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
